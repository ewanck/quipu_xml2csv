1,1420,1554,348,482,3000,"Our town, Sondorillo is poor and very dry. "
2,1388,1464,482,558,3000,"So, there they encouraged us to do that …"
3,1388,1490,558,660,3000,What's it called? … the sterilisation operation. 
4,1388,1477,671,760,3000," Well, you have to work, "
5,1388,1483,760,855,3000,"There's no wage and your husband is inattentive, "
6,1388,1469,855,936,3000,so one has to find a way to work. 
7,1388,1445,947,1004,3000,"I had 7 children, "
8,1388,1474,1004,1090,3000,and all 7 of them were small and I still had to work. 
9,1412,1539,1105,1232,3000,"When your husband ignores you and you don't have a wage, "
10,1376,1431,1232,1287,3000," well, you have to think and work hard. "
11,1388,1424,1287,1323,3000,"And up there in the hills it is dry, "
12,1388,1438,1323,1373,3000,"There's no water, "
13,1388,1468,1373,1453,3000,"so they told me not to have too many children, "
14,1378,1452,1453,1527,3000,because I worked hard and could fall ill. 
15,1388,1425,1527,1564,3000,That's true.
16,1388,1471,1564,1647,3000,"But the thing is that since the operation our health is delicate,  "
17,1388,1466,1647,1725,3000,"That's the only thing, nothing more."
