0,2830,2880,31,81,2880,"I wanted to throw up, "
1,2825,2864,81,120,2880,"I had a headache,"
2,2831,2880,120,169,2880,I didn't know what was happening to me.
3,2785,2880,169,264,2880,I realised I'd been sterilised. 
4,2813,2863,264,314,2880,"My tummy hurt, I felt my tummy "
5,2831,2880,314,363,2880,but I couldn't get any words out. 
6,2792,2830,363,401,2880,"I wondered, 'What have I done? "
7,2830,2879,401,450,2880,Am I in prison? Am I in hospital?'
8,2790,2821,450,481,2880,"I couldn't remember, "
9,2798,2845,481,528,2880,after a while I remembered 
10,2845,2874,528,557,2880,and I wanted to throw up
11,2790,2852,557,619,2880,"and a nurse came and said, 'What's wrong with you? "
12,2817,2880,619,682,2880,Don't make a mess in that bed'. 
13,2813,2850,682,719,2880,I felt awful. 
14,2847,2874,719,746,2880,I was screaming 
15,2810,2880,746,816,2880,and every now and then they came and held our faces 
16,2787,2880,816,909,2880,"and said 'shut up, just shut up!'. "
17,2788,2858,909,979,2880,The next day at 6am 
18,2785,2843,979,1037,2880,"everyone was crying, "
19,2822,2880,1037,1095,2880,"women crying here and women crying there, "
20,2806,2852,1095,1141,2880,so many of them crying. 
21,2803,2880,1141,1218,2880,"I had already realised that they'd been sterilised, "
22,2806,2862,1218,1274,2880,that's why they were crying. 
23,2801,2863,1274,1336,2880,A bit later the doctor came  
24,2804,2835,1336,1367,2880,and gave us an injection.
25,2820,2867,1367,1414,2880,"He didn't ask what was wrong with us, "
26,2824,2864,1414,1454,2880,he just gave us the injection and said 
27,2807,2877,1454,1524,2880,'you're discharged and you have to go home.' 
28,2803,2877,1524,1598,2880,"So I went out of the hospital with my tummy, "
29,2778,2875,1598,1695,2880,"all of the women went out, not just me, all of us holding onto our tummies. "
30,2800,2857,1695,1752,2880,"There was no transport arranged for us, "
31,2835,2880,1752,1797,2880,we all had to make our own way home â€¦
32,2841,2880,1797,1836,2880,"There was no ambulance, nothing. "
