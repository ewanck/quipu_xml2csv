1,2762,2819,103,160,2880,I live in the village of Nangali.
2,2766,2846,175,255,2880,"One of my children was malnourished, "
3,2758,2835,255,332,2880,"so I went to the medical centre to get food,"
4,2823,2880,332,389,2880,I went to ask them for food 
5,2782,2816,389,423,2880,"then the nurses,"
6,2808,2877,423,492,2880,"the nurses from Nangali's medical centre, "
7,2806,2831,492,517,2880,said to me:
8,2766,2877,517,628,2880,'We will give you the food but only if you go and get yourself sterilised.
9,2798,2856,628,686,2880,If you don't we won't give you any food 
10,2820,2880,686,746,2880,"because you all have too many children,"
11,2822,2862,746,786,2880,"you're like rabbits, "
12,2831,2880,786,835,2880,and don't want to be sterilised. 
13,2831,2874,835,878,2880," I went to Huancabamba, "
14,2781,2875,878,972,2880,"And I got to the hospital and I was the last one there, "
15,2818,2880,972,1034,2880,"I got there a bit late, "
16,2779,2880,1034,1135,2880,"On one side there was a man who was getting a vasectomy,"
17,2779,2818,1135,1174,2880,he was from Huambanaca.
18,2799,2880,1174,1255,2880,and he was already naked. 
19,2814,2878,1255,1319,2880,They said: 'Come in. Are you here to be sterilised?'
20,2821,2841,1319,1339,2880, 'Yes.' 
21,2815,2871,1339,1395,2880,They took off my clothes 
22,2783,2880,1395,1492,2880,"and I felt embarrassed with the man there, because he was naked,"
23,2776,2825,1492,1541,2880,and I didn't want to do it anymore. 
24,2819,2875,1541,1597,2880,"'Come on, hurry up!', they said, "
25,2817,2855,1597,1635,2880,They put me on the bed 
26,2829,2880,1635,1686,2880,and four of them held me down. 
27,2803,2865,1686,1748,2880,"Two held my arms down and two held my legs, "
28,2798,2833,1748,1783,2880,"so they could give me the injection, "
29,2800,2830,1783,1813,2880,and I don't remember any more. Â
