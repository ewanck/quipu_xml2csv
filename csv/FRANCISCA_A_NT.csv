1,1474,1539,221,286,2880,from the village of Ulpamache
2,1474,1590,315,431,2880,I was also affected by the time of violence
3,1590,1683,431,524,2880,when they were doing the operations to sterilize people. 
4,1590,1675,524,609,2880,The sterilizations came with tricks. 
5,1590,1631,619,660,2880,"They insisted, "

7,1624,1686,749,811,2880,"that we couldn't have any more family,"
8,1624,1665,811,852,2880, that our families were too big already
9,1665,1771,852,958,2880,and we wouldn't be able to support them in the future. 
10,1664,1752,967,1055,2880, I was sterilized when I was 25 years of age. 
11,1664,1711,1066,1113,2880,And then they said

13,1711,1798,1198,1285,2880,and they said that there was a new law
14,1711,1781,1285,1355,2880,that said that we had to have the operation. 
15,1774,1851,1355,1432,2880,"That we should take the opportunity, because the operation was free."
16,1774,1868,1432,1526,2880,"Then we â€¦  In my case I said no, "
17,1774,1845,1526,1597,2880,"because our work here in the countryside is hard,"
18,1842,1906,1597,1661,2880,"that we live from our fields,"
19,1841,1894,1661,1714,2880,we work with wool. 
20,1882,1965,1714,1797,2880,"Here in the countryside we carry wood,"
21,1882,1934,1797,1849,2880,"from our ranch in our saddlebag, "
22,1927,2015,1849,1937,2880,and we wouldn't be able to live like that anymore.
