0,1360,1410,84,134,2880,I'm from Nangali. 
1,1410,1467,134,191,2880,I'm concerned about my mom
2,1467,1499,191,223,2880,who is sick
3,1509,1569,233,293,2880,because of that corrupt government 
4,1508,1578,314,384,2880,that wrongly sterilised her.
5,1506,1557,399,450,2880,If I had been there
6,1557,1603,450,496,2880,as the eldest son 
7,1506,1550,509,553,2880,I feel bad to see my mom. 
8,1550,1614,553,617,2880,"But it was that corrupt,"
9,1509,1556,617,664,2880,"that president,"
10,1545,1578,672,705,2880,if he showed his face...
11,1509,1551,705,747,2880,"it is because of him,"
12,1532,1577,747,792,2880,"of that law, and now "
13,1505,1580,792,867,2880,there is no support.
14,1509,1569,867,927,2880,"They say there's going to be support,"
15,1509,1591,966,1048,2880,"and I see they are just tricking them,"
16,1509,1551,1048,1090,2880,the women
17,1551,1630,1090,1169,2880,who are involved in this project.
18,1509,1545,1169,1205,2880,Or maybe they are making profit
19,1545,1587,1205,1247,2880,and don't care about the 
20,1507,1567,1254,1314,2880,the women who are in the countryside. 
21,1507,1556,1317,1366,2880,"In that committee for example,"
22,1556,1583,1366,1393,2880,what are they gaining?
23,1583,1622,1393,1432,2880,"I don't know how it is, but "
24,1509,1595,1440,1526,2880,"anyway I'm worried about my mom, because, "
25,1509,1559,1537,1587,2880,because she can't do anything anymore.
26,1557,1594,1591,1628,2880,"She's losing her sight,"
27,1509,1533,1628,1652,2880,"her brain,"
28,1533,1578,1652,1697,2880,and her head all because of...
29,1507,1541,1700,1734,2880,It would have been better
30,1541,1583,1734,1776,2880,"if she didn't have the operation,"
31,1509,1569,1776,1836,2880,"she wouldn't be like this, and she would be calmer."
32,1509,1585,1836,1912,2880,"And myself, as the eldest son, would be calm as well"
33,1507,1582,1912,1987,2880,because I worry because she is sick
34,1509,1561,1995,2047,2880,because of this operation.
35,1561,1647,2047,2133,2880,How to blame her when I wasn't there?
36,1513,1570,2142,2199,2880,"If I had I wouldn't have allowed it,"
37,1509,1568,2199,2258,2880,it would have been better if she had family
38,1559,1608,2258,2307,2880,and she wouldn't be like she is now. 
39,1595,1639,2307,2351,2880,She's still not in an age
40,1633,1667,2351,2385,2880,to get sick but
41,1509,1547,2385,2423,2880,"because of that operation,"
42,1547,1579,2423,2455,2880,"of that corrupt, "
43,1508,1531,2471,2494,2880,"that,"
44,1537,1606,2500,2569,2880,"that president back then,"
45,1509,1547,2569,2607,2880,is that my mom is sick. 
46,1547,1608,2627,2688,2880,"And I also hope that you, as women,"
47,1509,1564,2703,2758,2880,"if you are profiting from this,"
48,1564,1594,2758,2788,2880,put effort.
49,1594,1671,2788,2865,2880,"I don't know how your reaction will be,"
50,1509,1557,2865,2913,2880,"because this has been on for years,"
51,1557,1587,2913,2943,2880,more than 10...
52,1506,1556,2943,2993,2880,and until now there is no hope.
53,1556,1589,2993,3026,2880,"I, as the eldest son"
54,1509,1569,3032,3092,2880,"of my dear mother,"
55,1509,1587,3092,3170,2880,I hope that you do something
56,1587,1663,3170,3246,2880,"and say if there is a solution,"
57,1509,1538,3246,3275,2880,and if not
58,1531,1595,3275,3339,2880,"then stop this, because they are losing their time,"
59,1595,1634,3339,3378,2880,going to meetings all the time
60,1508,1563,3389,3444,2880,and without any hope at all.
61,1563,1623,3444,3504,2880,That's my testimony and that's it.
