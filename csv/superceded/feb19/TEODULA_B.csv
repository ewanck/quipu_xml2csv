0,2831,2877,35,81,2880,"I felt sick, "
1,2825,2864,81,120,2880,I had a headache
2,2835,2880,120,165,2880,I didn't know what was happening to me.
3,2843,2872,168,197,2880,"Then, "
4,2813,2880,197,264,2880,I felt I was already ligated.
5,2813,2863,264,314,2880,"My belly hurt, I touched my belly "
6,2834,2879,314,359,2880,but I couldn't speak.
7,2792,2830,363,401,2880,I wondered: 'What have I done? 
8,2830,2879,401,450,2880,"Am I in prison, in the hospital?'"
9,2790,2819,450,479,2880,I didn't remember.
10,2798,2845,481,528,2880,After a while I remembered 
11,2845,2874,528,557,2880,and I felt sick 
12,2790,2852,557,619,2880,and a nurse came: 'What's wrong with you ma'am? 
13,2817,2880,619,682,2880,Don't you make a mess!'
14,2821,2855,690,724,2880,So it was horrible.
15,2847,2874,724,751,2880,I screamed 
16,2819,2880,751,812,2880,and all the time they came and grabbed our faces 
17,2793,2880,816,903,2880,"'Mrs. please shut up, Mrs. shut up!'. "
18,2788,2858,909,979,2880,The next day at 6am 
19,2788,2846,982,1040,2880,"there were people crying, "
20,2828,2879,1040,1091,2880,"women here and there, "
21,2806,2852,1091,1137,2880,there were many that cried.
22,2803,2880,1141,1218,2880,"I had already realised they had been ligated, "
23,2806,2861,1218,1273,2880,surely cause they were crying.
24,2805,2863,1278,1336,2880,"And a bit later the doctor came back, "
25,2804,2835,1336,1367,2880,"gave us a shot, "
26,2820,2861,1367,1408,2880,"Didn't ask us how we felt, "
27,2824,2864,1408,1448,2880,gave us a shot and said: 
28,2804,2880,1448,1524,2880,'Ok so you are discharged now and have to go home.'
29,2811,2832,1524,1545,2880,"So I, "
30,2827,2880,1548,1601,2880,"the women came out, not only me,"
31,2797,2880,1601,1684,2880,the women came out here and there grabbing their bellies.
32,2797,2859,1689,1751,2880,"There wasn't any transport no more to go back, "
33,2843,2880,1751,1788,2880,each one had to go home.
34,2840,2880,1788,1828,2880," There was no ambulance, nothing. "
