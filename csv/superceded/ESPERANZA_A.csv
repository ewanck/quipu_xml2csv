1,1432,1473,133,174,2880,"from the village of Rodeo Pampa, "
2,1473,1513,174,214,2880,very far away. 
3,1513,1553,214,254,2880,Well I… 
4,1563,1674,263,374,2880, many friends and I.. 
5,1674,1739,374,439,2880,they took us to the policlinic
6,1792,1827,439,474,2880,they took us to the policlinic
7,1827,1972,474,619,2880,more than a hundred women were gathered there
8,1972,2051,619,698,2880,one day when that committee came 
9,2051,2171,698,818,2880,and there they had us very imprisoned. 
10,2051,2107,818,874,2880,"They closed the gates,  "
11,2107,2251,874,1018,2880,"and then when some women saw how others cried with the pain "
12,2051,2151,1018,1118,2880,"they wanted to go out, but they wouldn’t let us go out anymore.  "
13,2151,2236,1118,1203,2880,So then they also took me inside
14,2236,2353,1203,1320,2880,and then they brought me to do the ligation
15,2353,2428,1320,1395,2880,and gave me the anesthesia.
16,2428,2489,1395,1456,2880,I was just falling asleep 
17,2489,2552,1456,1519,2880,and they started cutting me right away 
18,2552,2590,1519,1557,2880,and it hurt.
19,2587,2678,1557,1648,2880,Then I heard them saying: 
20,2678,2754,1648,1724,2880,‘the lady is pregnant’ 
21,2678,2711,1724,1757,2880,"Then I, "
22,2711,2852,1757,1898,2880,"because God didn’t want my baby to die at that moment, "
23,2711,2780,1898,1967,2880,"I said: ‘I don’t want you to take my baby out,"
24,2780,2867,1967,2054,2880,"I’d rather die with my baby, "
25,2821,2880,2054,2113,2880,and you won’t take my baby out.’
