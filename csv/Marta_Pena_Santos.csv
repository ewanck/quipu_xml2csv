1,1452,1513,80,141,3000,I'm Angelica Pena Santos. 
2,1430,1504,168,242,3000,I'm thankful that we are here at a meeting 
3,1388,1511,242,365,3000,with all the friends that support us by adding their grain of sand. 
4,1388,1432,365,409,3000,"We suffer because we are poor, "
5,1388,1454,409,475,3000,orphaned from the deaths of our father and mother. 
6,1388,1584,475,671,3000,My husband also had an accident because of the government. 
7,1445,1551,698,804,3000,So I was left alone with my children 
8,1388,1439,804,855,3000,"and there's no one to support me, "
9,1388,1432,855,899,3000,no one to help. 
10,1388,1450,899,961,3000,"Two of my children grew up and left, "
11,1388,1422,961,995,3000,two of them died 
12,1388,1427,995,1034,3000,and now I'm alone.
13,1388,1438,1034,1084,3000,"I'm a poor woman, "
14,1388,1504,1084,1200,3000,incapacitated because of that operation to sterilise me. 
15,1410,1454,1229,1273,3000,That's why I want support.
