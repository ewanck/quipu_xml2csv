1,1398,1477,111,190,2880,and my name is Maria Magdalena Pusma Huamán.
2,1491,1609,204,322,2880,"I went to the medical centre and they told us that we had to get ourselves sterilised,"
3,1609,1641,322,354,2880,and I didn’t want to.
4,1609,1688,356,435,2880,"I came (home) because I had to talk to my husband about it,"
5,1688,1758,435,505,2880,"but he wanted me to do it, so I had to.  "
6,1609,1652,511,554,2880,"But it was against my will,"
7,1652,1737,554,639,2880,"I didn’t want to, but they took me against my will. "
8,1609,1640,650,681,2880,So then...
9,1609,1686,693,770,2880,They took us to Huancabamba in an ambulance.
10,1609,1737,785,913,2880,When we got there they wanted to take us out of the ambulance
11,1609,1673,913,977,2880,but I I didn’t want to do it because I was nervous
12,1673,1706,977,1010,2880,and I just couldn’t. 
13,1609,1717,1010,1118,2880,"So two of them held me down to give me the injection and then we went to the"
14,1677,1747,1128,1198,2880,to where they were going to do the sterilisation.
15,1607,1672,1222,1287,2880,"It was just like that, "
16,1672,1716,1287,1331,2880,"but we haven’t been well,  "
17,1716,1778,1331,1393,2880,we ended up very unwell and we can’t work anymore. 
18,1607,1680,1409,1482,2880,And our husbands behave badly 
19,1680,1719,1482,1521,2880,because we can’t work anymore.
20,1608,1640,1534,1566,2880,"But this is how we are now, "
21,1609,1667,1566,1624,2880,"what we want is to get some support,"
22,1616,1667,1624,1675,2880,"some medicine, or money, "
23,1609,1668,1675,1734,2880,whatever so that we can buy medicine
24,1609,1673,1745,1809,2880, and feel a bit better.
