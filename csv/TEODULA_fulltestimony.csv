0,2762,2840,105,183,2880,"I am Teodula Pusma Carrion,"
1,2762,2819,186,243,2880,I live in the village of Nangali.
2,2749,2880,248,379,2880,"One of my children was malnourished, "
3,2746,2880,379,513,2880,"so I went to the medical centre to get food,"
4,2746,2813,513,580,2880,"because back then they gave us food, "
5,2746,2806,580,640,2880,it was called PANFAR. 
6,2746,2810,640,704,2880,So I decided to go 
7,2746,2804,704,762,2880,"because my son was malnourished, "
8,2782,2816,762,796,2880,"then the nurses,"
9,2808,2877,796,865,2880,"the nurses from Nangali's medical centre, "
10,2806,2831,865,890,2880,said to me:
11,2766,2877,890,1001,2880,'We will give you the food but only if you go and get yourself sterilised.
12,2798,2856,1001,1059,2880,If you don't we won't give you any food 
13,2820,2880,1059,1119,2880,"because you all have too many children,"
14,2822,2862,1119,1159,2880,"You're like rabbits, "
15,2831,2870,1159,1198,2880,and don't want to be sterilised. 
16,2831,2868,1198,1235,2880,If you get yourself sterilised
17,2828,2865,1235,1272,2880,"We'll keep giving you the food,"
18,2831,2847,1272,1288,2880,but otherwise not. 
19,2831,2863,1288,1320,2880,So I booked that slot
20,2819,2880,1320,1381,2880," I went to Huancabamba, "
21,2817,2880,1381,1444,2880,I walked there. 
22,2830,2875,1444,1489,2880,And I got to the hospital 
23,2819,2874,1489,1544,2880,"and I was the last one there, "
24,2224,2280,1544,1600,2880,"I got there a bit late, "
25,2233,2335,1624,1726,2880,"so I left my son, "
26,2233,2286,1726,1779,2880,"who was 6 months old, "
27,2233,2280,1779,1826,2880,"I left him with another man, "
28,2233,2284,1826,1877,2880,because he was there with his wife 
29,2233,2284,1877,1928,2880,who had just been sterilised . 
30,2233,2284,1928,1979,2880,So I left my son with him 
31,2233,2317,1979,2063,2880,so he could look after him 
32,2233,2265,2063,2095,2880,and I went inside. 
33,2233,2284,2095,2146,2880,I was the last one there. 
34,2795,2880,2146,2231,2880,"On one side there was a man who was getting a vasectomy,"
35,2779,2818,2231,2270,2880,he was from Huambanaca.
36,2799,2880,2270,2351,2880,and he was already naked. 
37,2814,2878,2351,2415,2880,They said: 'Come in. Are you here to be sterilised?'
38,2821,2841,2415,2435,2880, 'Yes'. 
39,2785,2880,2435,2530,2880,They took off my clothes 
40,2782,2879,2530,2627,2880,"and I felt embarrassed with the man there, because he was naked,"
41,2810,2854,2627,2671,2880,and I didn't want to do it anymore. 
42,2822,2875,2671,2724,2880,"'Come on, hurry up!', they said, "
43,2848,2877,2724,2753,2880,They put me on the bed 
44,2827,2880,2753,2806,2880,and four of them held me down. 
45,2821,2880,2806,2865,2880,"Two held my arms down and two held my legs, "
46,2819,2844,2865,2890,2880,"so they could give me the injection, "
47,2811,2838,2890,2917,2880,and I don't remember any more.  
48,2808,2841,2917,2950,2880,At midnight
49,2812,2880,2950,3018,2880,"I wanted to throw up, "
50,2827,2864,3018,3055,2880,"I had a headache,"
51,2821,2880,3055,3114,2880,I didn't know what was happening to me.
52,2725,2880,3114,3269,2880,I realised I'd been sterilised. 
53,2819,2872,3269,3322,2880,"My tummy hurt, I felt my tummy "
54,2841,2880,3322,3361,2880,but I couldn't get any words out. 
55,2841,2874,3361,3394,2880,"I just looked, "
56,2820,2880,3394,3454,2880,looked with the light that came to my eyes 
57,2821,2880,3454,3513,2880,in a very small bed. 
58,2826,2880,3513,3567,2880,"I was cold,"
59,2802,2830,3567,3595,2880,"I wondered, 'What have I done? "
60,2830,2879,3595,3644,2880,Am I in prison? Am I in hospital?'
61,2790,2821,3644,3675,2880,"I couldn't remember, "
62,2798,2845,3675,3722,2880,after a while I remembered 
63,2838,2880,3722,3764,2880,and I wanted to throw up
64,2790,2866,3764,3840,2880,"and a nurse came and said, 'What's wrong with you? "
65,2764,2880,3840,3956,2880,Don't make a mess in that bed'. 
66,2730,2854,3977,4101,2880,And she gave me a potty or something
67,2757,2865,4101,4209,2880,"and said 'use this, make sure you do it here.'"
68,2813,2850,4209,4246,2880,I felt awful. 
69,2847,2874,4246,4273,2880,I was screaming 
70,2810,2873,4273,4336,2880,and every now and then they came and held our faces 
71,2787,2880,4336,4429,2880,"and said 'shut up, just shut up!' "
72,2788,2880,4429,4521,2880,The next day at 6am 
73,2807,2860,4521,4574,2880,"everyone was crying, "
74,2823,2880,4574,4631,2880,"women crying here and women crying there, "
75,2822,2869,4631,4678,2880,so many of them crying. 
76,2813,2880,4678,4745,2880,"I had already realised that they'd been sterilised, "
77,2806,2862,4745,4801,2880,That's why they were crying. 
78,2806,2853,4816,4863,2880,The nurse was annoyed 
79,2797,2874,4863,4940,2880,and said 'get up now and wash your face.  
80,2806,2834,4940,4968,2880, The doctor's coming 
81,2780,2821,4968,5009,2880,and he's going to see you with a dirty face.  
82,2806,2841,5009,5044,2880,"You're going home already, "
83,2806,2854,5044,5092,2880,"you can't stay here, "
84,2806,2865,5092,5151,2880,so get up and wash your face 
85,2806,2876,5151,5221,2880,"and then you'll go home, "
86,2806,2850,5221,5265,2880,You'll be discharged.' 
87,2801,2857,5265,5321,2880,A bit later the doctor came  
88,2804,2835,5321,5352,2880,and gave us an injection.
89,2820,2867,5352,5399,2880,"He didn't ask what was wrong with us, "
90,2824,2864,5399,5439,2880,he just gave us the injection and said 
91,2807,2873,5439,5505,2880,'you're discharged and you have to go home.' 
92,2765,2875,5505,5615,2880,"So I went out of the hospital with my tummy, "
93,2746,2880,5615,5749,2880,"all of the women went out, not just me, all of us holding onto our tummies. "
94,2772,2819,5749,5796,2880,"We couldn't walk, "
95,2759,2805,5796,5842,2880,we couldn't stand up straight. 
96,2759,2868,5842,5951,2880,I was crying as I came out of the hospital
97,2793,2857,5951,6015,2880,"There was no transport arranged for us, "
98,2835,2880,6015,6060,2880,we all had to make our own way home …
99,2841,2880,6060,6099,2880,"There was no ambulance, nothing. "
100,2841,2871,6099,6129,2880,And they lied to us 
101,2827,2880,6129,6182,2880,saying they would give us something
102,2827,2858,6182,6213,2880,that they would help us.  
103,2824,2880,6213,6269,2880,"They just forgot about us, "
104,2827,2870,6269,6312,2880,they don't want to know nothing
105,2827,2866,6312,6351,2880,"They don't help us with anything, "
106,2827,2864,6351,6388,2880,they don't care about as at all. 
107,2827,2872,6388,6433,2880,"They say we've done this to ourselves, "
108,2832,2860,6433,6461,2880,and 'screw you'.
109,1311,1390,6467,6546,2880,"Things aren't good now with my husband, "
110,1385,1419,6546,6580,2880,we just fight all the time.
111,1428,1497,6580,6649,2880,"I can't help him with any of the work in the fields, "
112,1492,1574,6649,6731,2880,I can't help him use anything heavy.  
113,1490,1602,6731,6843,2880,I don't want to be intimate with him anymore. 
114,1490,1560,6843,6913,2880,"I get dark patches in front of my eyes, "
115,1560,1628,6913,6981,2880,I want to throw up. 
116,1560,1598,6981,7019,2880,"I get dizzy,"
117,1598,1661,7019,7082,2880,my whole body hurts. 
118,1661,1705,7082,7126,2880,"I just can't do it,"
119,1660,1736,7126,7202,2880,I'm not that old yet but I can't do it anymore. 
120,1649,1725,7202,7278,2880,"I live on my own with my husband, we have fight after fight "
121,1725,1839,7278,7392,2880,"because when I was well, before I was sterilised, I helped him to do things,"
122,1756,1780,7392,7416,2880, he was usually calm. 
123,1725,1760,7416,7451,2880,"The two of us would go out to work together, "
124,1725,1771,7451,7497,2880,"we had what we needed for our children, "
125,1725,1808,7497,7580,2880, at least enough to eat. 
126,1725,1792,7580,7647,2880,"And now, my children have left, "
127,1725,1747,7647,7669,2880,"one to one place, "
128,1725,1752,7669,7696,2880,the other to another place
129,1725,1758,7696,7729,2880,and now I live on my own. 
130,1725,1766,7729,7770,2880,"When the man goes to work, "
131,1725,1762,7770,7807,2880,"when my husband goes to work, "
132,1725,1753,7807,7835,2880,"sometimes he arrives late, "
133,1725,1744,7835,7854,2880,"sometimes not, "
134,1718,1738,7854,7874,2880,sometimes a bit drunk 
135,1725,1755,7874,7904,2880,'what have you done?'
136,1725,1775,7904,7954,2880,'what are you doing?'
137,1725,1759,7954,7988,2880,Or 'you haven't done this'
138,1725,1755,7988,8018,2880,"But it isn't laziness, "
139,1725,1755,8018,8048,2880,It's because I can't do it anymore 
140,1725,1756,8048,8079,2880,and he gets angry 
141,1725,1789,8079,8143,2880,"because I can't help him with work like I used to, "
142,1706,1770,8143,8207,2880,when I was well and I helped him to work. 
143,1725,1772,8207,8254,2880,"Now my children have left, "
144,1725,1778,8254,8307,2880,"they said 'Mum I want to study, "
145,1725,1759,8307,8341,2880,I want to move forward with my life'. 
146,1725,1769,8341,8385,2880," I didn't support them anymore, "
147,1725,1746,8385,8406,2880,"not with anything, "
148,1725,1820,8406,8501,2880,"so they took their own path, "
149,1791,1834,8501,8544,2880,"one went this way, "
150,1725,1771,8544,8590,2880,"the other went that way, "
151,1725,1777,8590,8642,2880, and they left me on my own
152,1725,1755,8642,8672,2880,"And now I can't do anything, "
153,1774,1828,8672,8726,2880,I should have had my children instead
154,1828,1876,8726,8774,2880,"and then I'd be like a rabbit,"
155,1876,1920,8774,8818,2880,"like they said, "
156,1864,1920,8818,8874,2880,but I'd have my children 
157,1920,1964,8874,8918,2880,and I wouldn't be here on my own suffering. 
158,1725,1834,8918,9027,2880,"I don't have anyone to run an errand for me, "
159,1725,1796,9027,9098,2880,"I have to do everything myself, even if it hurts "
160,1725,1744,9098,9117,2880,I have to do it 
161,1725,1821,9117,9213,2880,"so that we don't fight  too much, "
162,1725,1761,9213,9249,2880,so that he stays with me. 
163,1725,1800,9249,9324,2880,"Whether I want to or don't want to, "
164,1725,1822,9324,9421,2880,I have to do what I can myself. 
165,1725,1758,9430,9463,2880,"I'm really unwell, "
166,1725,1758,9463,9496,2880,I thought they would …
167,1929,1961,9496,9528,2880,"They tricked us,"
168,1961,2024,9528,9591,2880,"they told us they'd help us with medicines,"
169,1725,1807,9591,9673,2880,"that they wouldn't leave us on our own, "
170,1716,1810,9673,9767,2880,that we shouldn't feel bad because they would support us.
171,2041,2095,9767,9821,2880,"And now nothing, they've forgotten about us, "
172,2095,2137,9821,9863,2880,It's all been forgotten …
173,2095,2155,9863,9923,2880,"Now we are sick, "
174,2147,2199,9923,9975,2880,"all the women who were sterilised, "
175,2199,2227,9975,10003,2880,"all of us,"
176,2227,2276,10003,10052,2880,"but well, it has already been done."
177,1709,1819,10052,10162,2880,"and now we're asking that they maybe help us, "
178,1725,1773,10162,10210,2880,"that they support us a little, "
179,1725,1763,10210,10248,2880,"even just a little, "
180,1725,1776,10248,10299,2880,"some support, "
181,1725,1790,10299,10364,2880,even just at least some medicine 
182,1725,1771,10364,10410,2880,so we're not so unwell.
183,1732,1830,10416,10514,2880,"And also to thank the young women, "
184,1731,1792,10520,10581,2880,"Mrs. Josefa,"
185,1725,1794,10581,10650,2880,the women from the committee IAMAMC-AHMBA 
186,1712,1762,10650,10700,2880,that are doing something for us. 
187,2234,2296,10700,10762,2880,And that's all I wanted to say. 
188,2232,2367,10762,10897,2880,"And thanks for all of this, many thanks, thank you very much.   "
