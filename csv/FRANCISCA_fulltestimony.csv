0,1320,1412,67,159,2880,I am Francisca Quispe Pontenciano
1,1474,1539,221,286,2880,from the village of Ulpamache
2,1474,1533,445,504,2880,I'm from Ulpamache
3,1465,1590,504,629,2880,I was also affected by the time of violence
4,1590,1692,629,731,2880,when they were doing the operations to sterilize people. 
5,1590,1684,731,825,2880,The sterilizations came with tricks. 
6,1598,1659,825,886,2880,"They insisted, "
7,1624,1690,886,952,2880,they tricked us 
8,1624,1729,957,1062,2880,"by saying we were going to be OK, "
9,1624,1689,1062,1127,2880,"that we couldn't have any more family,"
10,1624,1678,1127,1181,2880, that our families were too big already
11,1665,1767,1181,1283,2880,and we wouldn't be able to support them in the future. 
12,1664,1744,1283,1363,2880, I was sterilized when I was 25 years of age. 
13,1660,1733,1363,1436,2880,"They said that, if I was only 25 now, "
14,1662,1721,1436,1495,2880,I could end up with more than a dozen children …
15,1664,1711,1495,1542,2880,And then they said
16,1711,1796,1542,1627,2880,'Where are you going to leave such a big family?'
17,1711,1798,1627,1714,2880,and they said that there was a new law
18,1711,1801,1714,1804,2880,that said that we had to have the operation. 
19,1794,1875,1804,1885,2880,"That we should take the opportunity, because the operation was free."
20,1794,1881,1885,1972,2880,"Then we … In my case I said no, "
21,1795,1866,1976,2047,2880,"because our work here in the countryside is hard,"
22,1863,1926,2047,2110,2880,"that we live from our fields,"
23,1861,1915,2110,2164,2880,we work with wool. 
24,1908,1985,2169,2246,2880,"Here in the countryside we carry wood,"
25,1902,1957,2246,2301,2880,"from our ranch in our saddlebag, "
26,1950,2044,2301,2395,2880,and we wouldn't be able to live like that anymore.
27,1930,2007,2395,2472,2880,Then the doctors said no
28,1930,1995,2472,2537,2880,"that it was just a simple cut, "
29,1930,2010,2537,2617,2880,"that it wouldn't affect us at all, "
30,1930,2030,2625,2725,2880,"and that's how they have convinced us, "
31,1930,1990,2725,2785,2880,"with tricks saying no, no and no. "
32,1930,1989,2785,2844,2880," Asking where we would leave those children in the future, "
33,1930,1967,2844,2881,2880,so many things.
34,1930,2012,2881,2963,2880,"And we said we would think about it, "
35,1918,1975,2963,3020,2880,we went home 
36,1989,2050,3020,3081,2880,"and the nurses kept looking for us,"
37,1992,2091,3081,3180,2880,"wherever we were, as if we were delinquents."
38,1991,2037,3184,3230,2880,Wherever we were.
39,2016,2102,3230,3316,2880,They even told us to do it without telling our husbands.
40,2019,2181,3316,3478,2880,"'Your husband won't accept, he probably wants you to be filled with children' ... "
41,2021,2047,3478,3504,2880,so many things. 
42,2047,2111,3504,3568,2880,And that's how they forced us.
43,2047,2109,3568,3630,2880,They forced us because we were weak
44,2047,2136,3630,3719,2880,they forced us to get sterilized
45,2047,2081,3722,3756,2880,"They brought us here, "
46,2047,2178,3756,3887,2880,"they ligated us here in the policlinic, "
47,2046,2120,3887,3961,2880,which we call hospital. 
48,2046,2104,3961,4019,2880,They sterilized us 
49,2046,2141,4019,4114,2880,"and they never gave us any treatment, "
50,2033,2120,4114,4201,2880,or told us what medicines to use.
51,2046,2098,4201,4253,2880,"As we say in our land, "
52,2098,2170,4253,4325,2880,they treated us like animals
53,2098,2172,4325,4399,2880,like wounded animals. 
54,2097,2202,4399,4504,2880,"They sent us home without treatment for anything, "
55,2096,2134,4504,4542,2880,nothing at all.
56,2096,2210,4542,4656,2880,"Then we just healed with whatever, "
57,2096,2154,4656,4714,2880,with what God gave us. 
58,2096,2169,4714,4787,2880,He didn't want us to die at that moment. 
59,2096,2206,4787,4897,2880,"And that is why we are looking for justice, "
60,2128,2218,4897,4987,2880,justice and reparation for our lives. 
61,2126,2207,4987,5068,2880,"Now they have left us incapacitated, "
62,2128,2158,5068,5098,2880,"with half a life,"
63,2158,2222,5098,5162,2880,we can't do anything now.
64,2158,2213,5162,5217,2880,They affected every part of us.
65,2158,2274,5217,5333,2880,"Why? Because they didn't give us any kind of medicine, "
66,2158,2201,5333,5376,2880,nothing. 
67,2158,2213,5376,5431,2880,"And now we are invalids,"
68,2158,2217,5431,5490,2880,we can't do anything anymore. 
69,2158,2222,5490,5554,2880,How to support ourselves? 
70,2158,2241,5554,5637,2880,"To support our health, "
71,2173,2213,5637,5677,2880,our lives. 
72,2173,2285,5677,5789,2880,If we can't work where are we going to get the money to live?  
73,2173,2396,5789,6012,2880,How will we end up when we are older?
74,2173,2240,6012,6079,2880,Many ladies. 
75,2173,2236,6079,6142,2880,"Now, in my case, "
76,2173,2253,6142,6222,2880,"I've totally decayed, "
77,2173,2276,6222,6325,2880,"and only because of what this government, "
78,2188,2246,6325,6383,2880,what Fujimorism did. 
79,2159,2297,6383,6521,2880,"If he did not want to see so many Peruvian mothers,"
80,2159,2214,6521,6576,2880,so many people in Peru.
81,2197,2276,6576,6655,2880,"well, it would have been better that he killed us, "
82,2251,2331,6655,6735,2880,so that we wouldn't have to live in this terrible situation 
83,2267,2308,6735,6776,2880,of endless suffering.
84,2301,2386,6784,6869,2880,How will we end up in the future?
85,2293,2408,6869,6984,2880,"Us mothers are on our knees, and it will be even worse,  "
86,2317,2382,6984,7049,2880,because we can't work.
87,2287,2383,7069,7165,2880,"This damned government, what he did."
88,2339,2408,7165,7234,2880,Now if he is asking for …
89,2347,2387,7234,7274,2880,"for pardon,"
90,2370,2436,7274,7340,2880,as for me I hope he dries up in prison.
91,2436,2516,7340,7420,2880,"He left so many people incapacitated here, "
92,2436,2465,7420,7449,2880,"many innocent people,"
93,2465,2506,7449,7490,2880,illiterate people. 
94,2491,2576,7490,7575,2880,He left us invalid.
95,2499,2681,7585,7767,2880,That is the testimony I give you now.
